# 📈 Stock Portfolio Tracker (Python)
The Stock Portfolio Tracker is a simple Python command-line program that allows users to manage their stock investments.
Users can input stock names and quantities, and the program calculates the total investment value using a hardcoded dictionary of stock prices.
It demonstrates how basic Python concepts—such as dictionaries, input/output, basic arithmetic, and optional file handling—can be combined to build a practical, real-world project.

# ⚙️ Key Concepts Used
   * Dictionary → to store stock prices ({"AAPL": 180, "TSLA": 250})
   * Input/Output → to take user input and display results in the console
   * Basic Arithmetic → to calculate total investment value
   * File Handling (optional) → to save the result into a .txt or .csv file

# 🌟 Features
   * Add multiple stocks and specify quantities.
   * Uses predefined stock prices stored in a dictionary.
   * Calculates and displays the total portfolio investment value.
   * Optionally saves results to a text or CSV file.
   * Simple and beginner-friendly command-line interface
